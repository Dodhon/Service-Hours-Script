# Service-Hours-Script
This script finds how many hours each person did and totals the service hours for my fraternity.

This code reads information from a CSV file that contains information from a google sheet. That google sheet was populated with information from a google form that people filled out when they completed their service hours. I got the idea for this script because I was unable to figure out how to total the service hours in google sheets.
